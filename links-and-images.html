<!-- this is an example of an image tag
the src attrtibute is the location of the image we want to display.
the src attrtibute can be an internet location(i.e https://www.google.com/...),
but the best practice is to have your own images folder that stores all the images you use on your website

NOTE: img is a self closing tag.
