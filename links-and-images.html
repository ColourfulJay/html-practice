<!-- 
    paragrapgs are an example of block elements, because by default 
    they take up the entire width of the webpage and take up space 
    at the top and bottom of the element
-->
<p> This web page shows the difference between blocks and inline elements!</p>
<!-- 
    anchors are an example of an inline element because, by default they only
    take up the space that they need to.

    We showed the difference bwtween block and inline elements using
     developer tools which we accessed useing ctrl+shift+i. 
     developer tools are helpful to show you the exact code that is used to display a 
     specific elements and can show you the width, hieght, 
     and spacing around an element

<!-- this is an example of an image tag
the src attrtibute is the location of the image we want to display.
the src attrtibute can be an internet location(i.e https://www.google.com/...),
but the best practice is to have your own images folder that stores all the images you use on your website

NOTE: img is a self closing tag.
